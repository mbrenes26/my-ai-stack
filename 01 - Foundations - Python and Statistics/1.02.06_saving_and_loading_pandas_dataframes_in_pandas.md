# 1.2.6 Saving and Loading Pandas DataFrames in Pandas

## Context
This lesson explains how to save and load Pandas DataFrames efficiently, focusing on file formats, cloud integration, and reproducibility in data workflows.

## Overview
Saving and loading data is critical for managing large datasets and ensuring reproducibility.  
This section covers reading and writing data using CSV and Excel formats, as well as accessing files through Google Drive in Colab.

## Key Concepts
- **Saving DataFrames** preserves analysis results for reuse.
- **Loading DataFrames** restores data for further processing.
- **CSV and Excel** are common formats for data exchange.
- **Google Drive integration** enables cloud-based collaboration.

## Worked Examples

### [00:04] Saving and Loading DataFrames
Creating DataFrames from lists or arrays is common for small datasets but inefficient for large datasets.

- For large data: use **flat files (CSV, Excel)** or connect to **databases**.
- Benefits: Avoid manual entry, reduce errors, and support millions of rows efficiently.

---

### [00:42] Importing CSV Files in Python
Use **`pd.read_csv()`** to load CSV data:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("filename.csv")
```

- In **Jupyter Notebook**: File must be in the same folder.
- In **Google Colab**: Data must be in **Google Drive** and mounted.

---

### [01:16] Mounting Google Drive in Google Colab
To access Drive files in Colab:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

- Authorize access by selecting your Google account.
- After mounting, use file paths like `/content/drive/MyDrive/data.csv`.

---

### [03:02] Uploading Files to Google Drive
Steps to upload files:

1. Drag and drop files into Google Drive.
2. Refresh the folder in Google Colab's file explorer.
3. Verify file path using `!ls /content/drive/MyDrive/`.

Benefit: Enables remote access and collaboration in cloud-based environments.

---

### [05:01] Reading Data from Excel Files
Pandas allows reading Excel files using `pd.read_excel()`:

```python
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx")
df.head()
```

- `.head()` displays the first 5 rows.
- Supports `.xls` and `.xlsx` file types.

---

### [05:46] Saving DataFrames to CSV and Excel
**Saving to CSV:**

```python
df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
```
- `index=False` excludes the index from the saved file.

**Saving to Excel:**

```python
df.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=True)
```
- Choose to include/exclude index based on its relevance.

---

## Formulas (plain text)
- Read CSV: `pd.read_csv("file.csv")`
- Read Excel: `pd.read_excel("file.xlsx")`
- Save CSV: `df.to_csv("file.csv", index=False)`
- Save Excel: `df.to_excel("file.xlsx", index=True)`
- Mount Drive: `drive.mount('/content/drive')`

---

## Summary
- Pandas simplifies saving and loading data with built-in functions.
- Use CSV and Excel for portability and compatibility.
- Google Drive integration supports cloud-based workflows.
- Efficient data management ensures reproducibility and collaboration.
