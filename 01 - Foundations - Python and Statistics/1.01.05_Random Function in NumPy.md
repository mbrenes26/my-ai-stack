# 1.1.5 Random Function in NumPy

This section provides a **comprehensive overview** of essential NumPy functions for working with matrices and generating random data. These are fundamental in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing**.

The content covers:
- Finding minimum and maximum values in matrices
- Generating random samples from uniform and normal distributions
- Generating random integers with optional sampling behavior

## [00:05] Finding Min and Max Values in Matrices

Python’s built‑in `min()` and `max()` functions work well for single‑dimensional arrays but can fail with **multidimensional arrays** due to ambiguity in comparing multiple elements.

NumPy provides optimized methods:
```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [4, 5, 6]])
print(np.min(matrix))  # 1
print(np.max(matrix))  # 9
```
Advantages:
- Works seamlessly with multidimensional arrays
- Avoids truth‑value ambiguity errors
- More efficient for large datasets

## [01:52] Generating Random Samples with `np.random.rand`

The `np.random.rand()` function generates random numbers from a **uniform distribution** between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Example:
```python
# Single‑dimensional array with 5 random numbers
arr = np.random.rand(5)

# 5×5 matrix of random values
matrix = np.random.rand(5, 5)

print(arr)
print(matrix)
```

## [03:50] Using `np.random.randn` for Normal Distribution

The `np.random.randn()` function generates samples from a **standard normal distribution**:
- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1
- Bell‑shaped probability curve

Example:
```python
# 2×3 matrix from normal distribution
samples = np.random.randn(2, 3)

# Larger sample for statistical accuracy
large_sample = np.random.randn(500, 500)

print(np.mean(large_sample))  # ≈ 0
print(np.std(large_sample))   # ≈ 1
```

Larger sample sizes improve the accuracy of statistical properties.

## [06:14] Generating Random Integers with `np.random.randint`

The `np.random.randint()` function generates **random integers** within a specified range:
- **low** (inclusive)
- **high** (exclusive)

Example:
```python
# Random integer between 1 and 10
num = np.random.randint(1, 10)

# 3×3 matrix of random integers from 0 to 99
matrix = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(3, 3))

print(num)
print(matrix)
```

Sampling is **with replacement** by default, meaning the same value may appear multiple times.
