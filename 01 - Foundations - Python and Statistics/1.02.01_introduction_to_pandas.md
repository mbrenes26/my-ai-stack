# 1.2.1 Introduction to Pandas

## Overview
Pandas is a Python library designed for **data manipulation** and **analysis**.  
It provides two key data structures — **Series** and **DataFrames** — that simplify handling structured data efficiently.  
Pandas integrates seamlessly with **NumPy**, making it essential for data science workflows.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Series**: One-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- **DataFrame**: Two-dimensional labeled data structure similar to an Excel sheet.
- **Indexing**: Each element or row has a label (index) for easy access.
- **Vectorized Operations**: Arithmetic operations apply element-wise across Series or DataFrames.
- **Data Creation**: DataFrames can be created from dictionaries, Series, or random data.

## Worked Examples

### [00:09] Importing Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
```
NOTE: Pandas is typically imported as `pd` for convenience.

---

### [00:43] Creating a Pandas Series
```python
import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['A', 'B', 'C'])
print(s)
```
Each value has an associated label, unlike NumPy arrays.

---

### [01:23] Converting Data Structures
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

medicines = ['Paracetamol', 'Ibuprofen', 'Aspirin']
prices = [500, 800, 300]

prices_array = np.array(prices)
series = pd.Series(prices_array, index=medicines)
print(series)
```
NOTE: Pandas is **case-sensitive** — use `pd.Series` (capital “S”).

---

### [04:50] Arithmetic Operations on Series
```python
series + 50  # Adds 50 to each value
```
Operations are **label-based**, ensuring alignment even if order changes.

---

### [09:01] Creating a DataFrame
```python
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
WARNING: Ensure all columns have consistent lengths.

---

### [11:11] DataFrames from Dictionaries and Series
```python
grades = {
    'Math': [85, 90, 78],
    'Science': [88, 84, 92]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(grades)
print(df)
```

From Series:
```python
s1 = pd.Series([85, 90, 78])
s2 = pd.Series([88, 84, 92])
df = pd.DataFrame({'Math': s1, 'Science': s2})
print(df)
```

---

### [14:19] Generating Random DataFrames
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df_random = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(5, 3),
    columns=['A', 'B', 'C']
)
print(df_random)
```
NOTE: Column names must match the number of data columns.

## Quiz Insights
- Q1: What are the two primary data structures in Pandas?  
  - **Answer:** Series and DataFrame — used for labeled one- and two-dimensional data.
- Q2: How does a Series differ from a NumPy array?  
  - **Answer:** Series includes labels (indexes), while NumPy arrays do not.

---

## Formulas (plain text)
- DataFrame creation: `df = pd.DataFrame(data)`
- Series creation: `s = pd.Series(values, index=labels)`
- Arithmetic operation: `series + constant`

---

## Summary
- Pandas simplifies data manipulation using Series and DataFrames.
- Series are labeled one-dimensional arrays; DataFrames are tabular structures.
- Supports vectorized operations for efficient computation.
- DataFrames can be created from dictionaries, Series, or random data.
- Pandas integrates seamlessly with NumPy for numerical tasks.
