# 1.1.5 Random Function in NumPy

## Context
This lesson explores NumPy’s random functions and their applications in data analysis, simulation, and machine learning. It demonstrates how to generate random data, find extremes, and understand distributions.

## Overview
NumPy provides efficient tools for generating random numbers and manipulating arrays.  
This section covers methods for finding minimum and maximum values, generating random samples, and creating random integers for simulations and testing.

## Key Concepts
- **`np.min()` / `np.max()`** find extremes in arrays.
- **`np.random.rand()`** generates uniform random samples.
- **`np.random.randn()`** generates normal (Gaussian) samples.
- **`np.random.randint()`** generates random integers.
- Random sampling is **with replacement** by default.

## Worked Examples

### [00:05] Finding Min and Max Values in Matrices
Python’s built-in `min()` and `max()` functions work well for single-dimensional arrays but can fail with **multidimensional arrays**.  
NumPy provides optimized methods:

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [4, 5, 6]])
print(np.min(matrix))  # 1
print(np.max(matrix))  # 9
```
Advantages:
- Works seamlessly with multidimensional arrays.
- Avoids truth-value ambiguity errors.
- More efficient for large datasets.

### [01:52] Generating Random Samples with `np.random.rand`
The `np.random.rand()` function generates random numbers from a **uniform distribution** between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

```python
# Single-dimensional array with 5 random numbers
arr = np.random.rand(5)

# 5×5 matrix of random values
matrix = np.random.rand(5, 5)

print(arr)
print(matrix)
```

### [03:50] Using `np.random.randn` for Normal Distribution
The `np.random.randn()` function generates samples from a **standard normal distribution**:
- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1

```python
# 2×3 matrix from normal distribution
samples = np.random.randn(2, 3)

# Larger sample for statistical accuracy
large_sample = np.random.randn(500, 500)

print(np.mean(large_sample))  # ≈ 0
print(np.std(large_sample))   # ≈ 1
```

Larger sample sizes improve the accuracy of statistical properties.

### [06:14] Generating Random Integers with `np.random.randint`
The `np.random.randint()` function generates **random integers** within a specified range:
- **low** (inclusive)
- **high** (exclusive)

```python
# Random integer between 1 and 10
num = np.random.randint(1, 10)

# 3×3 matrix of random integers from 0 to 99
matrix = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(3, 3))

print(num)
print(matrix)
```

Sampling is **with replacement** by default, meaning the same value may appear multiple times.

---

## Formulas (plain text)
- Minimum value: `np.min(array)`
- Maximum value: `np.max(array)`
- Uniform random sample: `np.random.rand(shape)`
- Normal random sample: `np.random.randn(shape)`
- Random integer: `np.random.randint(low, high, size)`

---

## Summary
- NumPy provides efficient random number generation tools.
- Use `np.min()` and `np.max()` for finding extremes.
- `np.random.rand()` and `np.random.randn()` generate uniform and normal samples.
- `np.random.randint()` creates random integers.
- Random sampling is essential for testing, simulation, and modeling.
