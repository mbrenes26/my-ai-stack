# 1.1.4 Operations on Matrices

## Context
This lesson demonstrates how to perform matrix operations using **NumPy**, focusing on creation, transformation, and computation techniques essential for data science and linear algebra.

## Overview
Matrix operations are fundamental in numerical computing.  
This section covers how to create, manipulate, and perform mathematical operations on matrices using NumPy.

## Key Concepts
- **Matrix creation and shaping** using `np.arange()` and `.reshape()`.
- **Identity matrices** as multiplicative identities.
- **Element-wise operations** for arithmetic computations.
- **Matrix multiplication (dot product)** for linear algebra.
- **Matrix transposition** for data reorientation.

## Worked Examples

### [00:10] Matrix Creation and Shaping
Matrix creation and shaping are **fundamental operations** in numerical computing.  
Using `np.arange()`, a one-dimensional array can be generated and reshaped into a **3×3 matrix**.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
print(matrix)
```
Reshaping arrays into matrices provides a **structured format** that is easier to manipulate and analyze, forming the foundation for matrix algebra.

### [00:23] Identity Matrix Creation
An **identity matrix** is a square matrix with **ones on the diagonal** and **zeros elsewhere**.  
It acts as the **multiplicative identity** in matrix multiplication—meaning any matrix multiplied by an identity matrix remains unchanged.

```python
identity = np.eye(3)
print(identity)
```
Identity matrices are essential in **linear algebra**, particularly when solving systems of linear equations.

### [00:55] Element-wise Matrix Operations
Element-wise operations apply arithmetic **to corresponding elements** of two matrices.

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print(A + B)  # Addition
print(A - B)  # Subtraction
print(A * B)  # Multiplication
print(A / B)  # Division
```
NOTE: Division by zero produces `inf` values, indicating undefined results.

These operations are similar to those performed on one-dimensional arrays but operate across all elements in the two-dimensional structure.

### [03:30] Matrix Multiplication and Dot Product
Matrix multiplication—also called the **dot product**—differs from element-wise multiplication.  
It involves multiplying **rows** of the first matrix by **columns** of the second and summing the results.

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print(A @ B)         # Using @ operator
print(np.dot(A, B))  # Equivalent method
```
Matrix multiplication is a **core concept** in:
- Machine learning
- Computer graphics
- Solving systems of equations

### [07:13] Matrix Transposition
Matrix transposition flips a matrix **over its diagonal**, swapping rows and columns.

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(A.T)               # Transpose shorthand
print(np.transpose(A))   # Equivalent function
```
Transposing is commonly used to **re-orient data** and simplify matrix equations in **linear algebra**.

## Formulas (plain text)
- Matrix creation: `np.arange(start, stop).reshape(rows, cols)`
- Identity matrix: `np.eye(n)`
- Element-wise operation: `A * B`
- Matrix multiplication: `A @ B` or `np.dot(A, B)`
- Transpose: `A.T`

---

## Summary
- NumPy simplifies matrix creation and manipulation.
- Identity matrices are essential for linear algebra operations.
- Element-wise operations apply arithmetic to all elements.
- Matrix multiplication enables advanced computations.
- Transposing reorients data for analysis and modeling.
