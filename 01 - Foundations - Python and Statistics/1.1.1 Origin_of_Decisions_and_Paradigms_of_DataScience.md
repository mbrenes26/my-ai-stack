# ðŸ“˜ Origin of Decisions and Paradigms of Data Science and AI

## 1. Origin of Decisions

**Key Message:**  
Decisionsâ€”both ancient and modernâ€”are **data-driven**.

### Historical Context:
Early civilizations faced key questions like:
- **When to stock firewood?**
- **When is the best time to travel?**
- **When to start cultivating a crop?**

All these are tied to a fundamental task: **Predict the weather**

> Inputs for weather prediction:
> - Geography  
> - Pressure  
> - Rainfall  
> - Temperature  
> - Humidity  

**Purpose:** Growth & sustenance of the community

> **Modern Analogy:**  
Today, businesses follow the same data-driven process, but with greater **speed and accuracy** thanks to:
- **Statistical techniques**
- **Computing capabilities**

## 2. Paradigms in Data Science

Two primary paradigms shape how data science and AI extract value from data:

### Inferential Paradigm
- **Focus:** Understanding populations from sample data
- **Methods:** Statistical inference, hypothesis testing
- **Limitations:** Data must be representative
- **Examples:**
  - Effectiveness of new medications (via randomized trials)
  - Impact of policy changes on citizens

### Computational Paradigm
- **Focus:** Leverage computation to scale insight generation
- **Methods:** Algorithms, machine learning, optimization
- **Limitations:** High computational cost and model complexity
- **Examples:**
  - Weather forecasting using historical patterns
  - Vehicle routing optimization to reduce cost

## Final Takeaway

> **Decision-making has always relied on pattern recognition.**
> The transformation lies in our **tools**: from direct observation â†’ statistics â†’ algorithms and AI.
