# 1.1.4 Operations on Matrices

This section provides a **comprehensive overview** of matrix operations using **NumPy**, a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It covers:

- Creating and shaping matrices
- Generating identity matrices
- Performing element‑wise matrix operations
- Executing matrix multiplication (dot product)
- Transposing matrices

## [00:10] Matrix Creation and Shaping

Matrix creation and shaping are **fundamental operations** in numerical computing.  
Using `np.arange()`, a one‑dimensional array can be generated and reshaped into a **3×3 matrix**.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
print(matrix)
```
Reshaping arrays into matrices provides a **structured format** that is easier to manipulate and analyze, forming the foundation for matrix algebra.

## [00:23] Identity Matrix Creation

An **identity matrix** is a square matrix with **ones on the diagonal** and **zeros elsewhere**.  
It acts as the **multiplicative identity** in matrix multiplication—meaning any matrix multiplied by an identity matrix remains unchanged.

Example:
```python
identity = np.eye(3)
print(identity)
```
Identity matrices are essential in **linear algebra**, particularly when solving systems of linear equations.

## [00:55] Element‑wise Matrix Operations

Element‑wise operations apply arithmetic **to corresponding elements** of two matrices.

Example:
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print(A + B)  # Addition
print(A - B)  # Subtraction
print(A * B)  # Multiplication
print(A / B)  # Division
```
⚠ **Note:** Division by zero produces `inf` values, indicating undefined results.

These operations are similar to those performed on one‑dimensional arrays, but they operate on all elements in the two‑dimensional structure.

## [03:30] Matrix Multiplication and Dot Product

Matrix multiplication—also called the **dot product**—differs from element‑wise multiplication.  
It involves multiplying **rows** of the first matrix by **columns** of the second and summing the results.

Example:
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print(A @ B)         # Using @ operator
print(np.dot(A, B))  # Equivalent method
```
Matrix multiplication is a **core concept** in:
- Machine learning
- Computer graphics
- Solving systems of equations

## [07:13] Matrix Transposition

Matrix transposition flips a matrix **over its diagonal**, swapping rows and columns.

Example:
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(A.T)               # Transpose shorthand
print(np.transpose(A))   # Equivalent function
```
Transposing is commonly used to **re‑orient data** and simplify matrix equations in **linear algebra**.
