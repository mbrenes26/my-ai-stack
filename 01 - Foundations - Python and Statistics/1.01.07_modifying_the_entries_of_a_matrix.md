# 1.1.7 Modifying the Entries of a Matrix

This section focuses on **accessing, modifying, and extracting** data from matrices using **NumPy**.  
It builds on the principles of working with single‑dimensional arrays, extending them to multi‑dimensional structures.

Topics covered:
- Accessing specific elements
- Modifying matrix entries
- Extracting subsets of a matrix
- Updating all values in a matrix
- Understanding reference‑based behavior

## [00:04] Matrix Operations and Accessing Elements

Matrix operations extend filtering concepts from arrays to matrices.  
You can access specific values using **row and column indices**.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

print(matrix[1])      # Entire 2nd row → [4 5 6]
print(matrix[1, 2])   # Element at (row 2, col 3) → 6
```

Using one index returns an entire row.  
Using two indices filters **both rows and columns** for precise element access.

---

## [01:59] Modifying Matrix Elements

Modify specific elements by specifying their **row and column positions**.

Example:
```python
matrix[1, 1] = 0        # Change (row 2, col 2) to 0
matrix[1:3, 3-2:3] = 0  # Change block of elements
print(matrix)
```

Understanding **zero‑indexing** and **exclusive range notation** ensures targeted modifications.

---

## [04:01] Extracting Subsets of a Matrix

You can extract a subset of rows and columns using slicing.

Example:
```python
sub_matrix = matrix[0:2, 0:3]  # First 2 rows, first 3 columns
print(sub_matrix)
```

This isolates specific data segments without altering the original matrix.

---

## [05:26] Updating All Matrix Values

You can change **all matrix values** to a single number.

Example:
```python
matrix[:, :] = 99
print(matrix)
```

⚠ Ensure proper indexing to maintain matrix structure and avoid converting it to a scalar.

---

## [07:03] Reference‑Based Behavior in Python

In NumPy, **subsets are views (references)** by default.  
Changes to a subset affect the **original matrix**.

Example:
```python
subset = matrix[0:2, 0:2]
subset[:, :] = 0
print(matrix)  # Original matrix changed
```

To avoid this, use `.copy()`:
```python
subset_copy = matrix[0:2, 0:2].copy()
subset_copy[:, :] = 0
print(matrix)  # Original matrix unchanged
```

Using `.copy()` preserves **data integrity** when working with extracted subsets.

---

## Summary

- Matrices extend array operations to two dimensions using **row and column indexing**.
- You can **modify specific elements or blocks** using slicing and assignment.
- **Subsets are views** by default, meaning changes affect the original matrix.
- Use `.copy()` to prevent unintended modifications.
- Proper indexing ensures **data integrity** and avoids structural errors.
