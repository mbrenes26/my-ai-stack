# my-ai-stack

A personal repository documenting my journey through the **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** program.  
This repo centralizes course notes, markdown summaries, and supporting materials related to AI, Machine Learning, and Cloud deployment.

## Purpose
Build a structured, reusable, version-controlled knowledge base: foundations → applied models → deployment practices.

## Videos (Proprietary)
Some markdown files reference **proprietary course videos** hosted privately in Azure Blob Storage.  
Links require authorization and are **not** included publicly; no copyrighted media is stored in this repository.
