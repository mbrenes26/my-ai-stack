# Recommendation Systems Quiz

## Overview
- Quiz covering key concepts, examples, and reasoning for recommendation systems

## Quiz Questions and Answers

### Question 1
**Which of the following is true about recommendation systems?**
- They can help item providers promote their items to right user
- They can help identify products most relevant to the user
- They can help websites improve user engagement and increase online sales
- All of the above

**Correct Answer:** All of the above  
**Reasoning:** Recommendation systems help recommend products, increase user engagement, identify relevant products, and help item providers reach the right users.

### Question 2
**Which of the following is an example of a Content-based Recommendation System?**
- A) Recommending movies to a user based on the movies rated by that user in the past
- B) Recommending the most popular movies
- C) Randomly recommending some selections from a list of movies

**Correct Answer:** Only A  
**Reasoning:** Content-based systems use user data to create a profile and recommend based on history. Popularity and random selection are not content-based.

### Question 3
**What is/are the advantage(s) of recommendation systems?**
- Provide a better experience for the users by giving them a broader exposure to many different products they might be interested in
- Encourage users towards continual usage or purchase of their product
- Benefit the service provider by increasing potential revenue
- All of the above

**Correct Answer:** All of the above  
**Reasoning:** Personalized recommendations improve user experience, encourage usage, and increase provider revenue.

### Question 4
**Which of the following could be the side effects of recommendation systems?**
- They can end up creating an information bubble
- Feedback loops
- Both of the above

**Correct Answer:** Both of the above  
**Reasoning:** Recommendation systems can create information bubbles and feedback loops.

---

### Question 5
**Recommending items that are similar to the items that the user has already purchased. This is an example of:**
- A. Item-based collaborative filtering
- B. User-based collaborative filtering

**Correct Answer:** Only A  
**Reasoning:** Item-based collaborative filtering measures similarity between items the user interacts with and other items.

---

### Question 6
**State whether the following sentence is True or False:**  
Cosine Similarity measures the similarity between two vectors by finding the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, and determining whether the two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction or not.

**Correct Answer:** True  
**Reasoning:** Cosine similarity measures similarity by the angle between vectors, regardless of their size.

### Question 7
**What is the sparsity problem in Recommendation Systems?**
- It is a problem that arises when only old products are recommended and newly added products are not recommended
- It is a problem that occurs when the machine learning algorithms fail to predict correctly
- It is a problem that arises because only a small percentage of all user-item interactions (such as views, clicks, ratings etc.) have actually taken place

**Correct Answer:** It is a problem that arises because only a small percentage of all user-item interactions have actually taken place  
**Reasoning:** Data sparsity occurs when most products are not rated/viewed, limiting recommendations.

---

### Question 8
**A recommendation engine, like Amazon, can recommend products while optimizing which of the following metrics.**
- 1. Customer satisfaction: matching users with products they might like.
- 2. Revenue optimization: matching users with products that would generate greater expected revenue/profit.
- 3. Information gathering: recommending products that allow more behavioral information about users to be captured.

**Correct Answer:** 1,2 & 3  
**Reasoning:** Recommendation engines can optimize all three: satisfaction, revenue, and information gathering.

### Question 9
**For an E-commerce website, the below details are given.  
User A likes product number 1, 2 and 3.  
User B likes product number 6, 3, and 4.  
And user C likes product number 1, 2 and 5.  
If you use user-based collaborative filtering to recommend new products to a user. Which product will be recommended to user C if he visits the e-commerce website?**
- 3
- 5
- 6
- 4

**Correct Answer:** 3  
**Reasoning:** User-based collaborative filtering matches users with similar interests; C is most similar to A, so C should be recommended product 3.

---

### Question 10
**State whether the following statement is True or False:**  
Content-based recommender systems can use both user and item features for the recommendations.

**Correct Answer:** True  
**Reasoning:** Content-based methods use available features to explain user-item interactions.

---

### Question 11
**Which of the following is a result of the popularity (using averaging) based recommendation system?**
- A curated playlist of "Top Hits of the Week" on a music app
- Product recommendations on a shopping app based on your recent purchases
- Book suggestions by a friend from her recent reads
- None of the above

**Correct Answer:** A curated playlist of "Top Hits of the Week"  
**Reasoning:** Popularity-based systems recommend items based on overall popularity, like "Top Hits".

---

### Question 12
**Recommending items using matrix estimation can be helpful in _____:**
- A) Providing personalized recommendations
- B) Capturing latent features of items from the user-item interaction matrix

**Correct Answer:** Both A and B  
**Reasoning:** Matrix estimation helps with personalized recommendations and capturing latent features.

---

### Question 13
**Assume that we want to make a recommendation to a given user. Select the correct order for the User-User collaborative filtering recommendation approach:**
- i) Represent every user by its vector of interactions with the different items
- ii) Find the k-nearest-neighbors (users) to the given user
- iii) Compute some kind of “similarity” between our user of interest and every other user
- iv) Suggest popular items among similar users (which the reference user hasn’t interacted with yet)

**Correct Answer:** i, iii, ii, iv  
**Reasoning:** The correct order is: represent users, compute similarity, find neighbors, suggest items.

### Question 14
**In which of the following situations will a collaborative filtering system be the most appropriate learning algorithm to use?**
- 1. You run an online gift store and you have ratings from many users. You want to predict the expected sales volume i.e number of gifts sold as a function of the average rating of gifts.
- 2. You manage a technical article website and you have ratings from many users. For each user, you want to recommend another article he/she will like based on his/her ratings and other users' ratings.

**Correct Answer:** Only 2  
**Reasoning:** Collaborative filtering is best for recommending items based on user ratings and other users' ratings.

---

### Question 15
**Which of the following are fundamental intuitions behind collaborative filtering?**
- A) Similar users will rate the items similarly
- B) Similar users will not rate the items similarly
- C) Similar items will be rated similarly

**Correct Answer:** Only A and C  
**Reasoning:** Collaborative filtering assumes similar users/items are rated similarly.

## Formulas (plain text)
- cosine_similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
- user-item interaction matrix: rows = users, columns = items
- matrix_estimation: latent features from user-item matrix

## Summary
- RecSys = match users to items, boost engagement/sales
- Content-based: uses user/item features
- Collaborative filtering: uses user-item interactions
- Sparsity is a real challenge
- Multiple metrics can be optimized
